# proofreadTextFromPDF
Proof reads text extracted from PDF files, by default in Swedish.
This can be changed in the prompt sent to OpenAI. 

Put all PDF files in a folder named PDF, or specify the path in the variable PDFpath.

You need an OpenAI API key environment variable. Remember OpenAI charges for the processing.

Unfortunately the results are dissappointing using GPT3 (text-davinci-003).
